I have considered a non-existing company named "XYZ-GoShip" which essentially deals with purchase and delivery of products and other shipment services.
Meet Cusum1.0, its first Customer Support Bot, which helps the company handle basic queries of customers related to website, contact, order status, products, delivery, feedback, complaint, etc.
